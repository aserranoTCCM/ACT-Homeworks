# MP2.
## Introduction.
This code is part of the Advanced Computational Techniques homework. The goal of this project is to compute the energy of different molecules at HF MP2 theory level. For this purpose we made a code in C using the [TREXIO](https://trex-coe.eu/trex-quantum-chemistry-codes/trexio) library.

**A breakdown of each file can be found below.**

- **INSTALL.md:** The purpose of this file is to bring clear instructions on how to compile and run the program. In addition a short explanation of how to use github will be given as well.

- **mp2.pdf:** This is the file containing the instructions for creating the MP2 code. It includes all the formulas and algorithms used.
  
- **data directory:** This directory is used to store all the inputs used to test the code.

- **output directory:** This directory is used to store all the outputs calculated with the code.

- **src directory:**  The C code can be found inside this directory.

- **Authors.md:** In this file, all the collaborators that have worked on the code can be found.
