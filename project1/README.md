# MP2
## Introduction.
This code is part of the Advanced Computational Techniques homework. The goal of this project is to compute the energy of different molecules at HF MP2 theory level. For this purpose we made a code in C using the [TREXIO](https://trex-coe.eu/trex-quantum-chemistry-codes/trexio) library.
## Runing the code.
To run the code the first step is to compile it
```console
gcc MP2_Lucia_Alvaro_Ander.c -o MP2_Lucia_Alvaro_Ander -ltrexio
```
