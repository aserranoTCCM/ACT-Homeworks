# Molecular Dynamics Directory

This directoy contains all the relevant files for project 3.

Project 3 consists on the creation of a C code which purpose is to illustrate key concepts in MD simulations. The program will read force field parameters and the initial positions of atoms from an input file and after each small displacement of atoms according to their velocieties, the updated coordinates will be saved to an output file, enabling the creation of a video animation with an external tool.

**A breakdown of each file can be found below.**
