## Getting Started
### 1. Download and access to the necessary files
- **1.a) Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command on the terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/aserranoTCCM/ACT-Homeworks```

Once you have the repository downloaded, navigate to the /src folder containing the code.

- **1.b) Download only the code and inputs**

This is only mandatory in case you don't want to download the whole repository, if you already downloaded the repository, skip these intructions.

First, navigate in the web version of the repository to the /src file and download the MD code by clicking on the download button on the top right corner.

Second, download the inputs directory in a similar way.

### 2. Compiling the code
